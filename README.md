# Issues

## why does npm installing run so slowly in docker?

Occasionally but not always, npm might run slowly. The actual speed depends on your situation. You can also see a related [issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8836). But it doesn't matter, since you can just leave it running and then come back after several minutes.

## why does node application keep restarting in docker when starting?

Though mariadb starts before node application, docker can not ensure the mariadb is ready for connection before node application tries to connect mariadb. Hence, node application will restart for several times to try connections until mariadb is ready for connection.
